    <h2>About The Author</h2>
    <p>L.J.D. Yencken is a researcher with a background in military service and institutional finance. He served as an infantryman in the Australian Army, with a deployment to Iraq, before turning to finance. He has worked in equity and derivatives trading across Asia and the United States, most recently with Morgan Stanley as a portfolio trader for hedge funds, pensions, and high-net-worth clients.</p>
    <p>He holds a Master of Science in Finance from the University of Southern California, a Master of Business Administration from the University of New South Wales, and a Graduate Diploma in Financial Planning from Kaplan.</p>
    <p>His work focuses on the intersection of economics, conflict, and markets. His research blends quantitative and qualitative reasoning. Some matters yield to numbers; others to judgment. Neither is enough alone.</p>
    <p>Yencken writes and publishes out of plain curiosity. He draws on both formal and informal study across philosophy, classical and ancient literature, history, mathematics, and the sciences. He holds that there is no substitute for a broad and disciplined education when seeking to understand the world, and no better means of reading what may come.</p>
