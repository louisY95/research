    <h2>About The Author</h2>
   <p>L. J. D. Yencken is an independent researcher working at the intersection of economics, security, and financial markets. His work combines quantitative modelling, historical comparison, and applied geopolitical analysis. He draws on both operational experience and institutional finance to assess the changing character of markets in an age of strategic realignment.</p>
   <p>Yencken served as an infantryman in the Australian Army, including a deployment to Iraq as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. After leaving full-time service, he worked in equity and derivatives trading across the Asia-Pacific and the United States. Most recently, he was a portfolio trader at Morgan Stanley, advising hedge funds, endowments, and high-net-worth clients on multi-asset strategies, with particular focus on volatility structures, tactical overlays, and alternative exposures.</p>
   <p>He holds a Master of Science in Finance from the University of Southern California, a Master of Business Administration from the University of New South Wales, and a Graduate Diploma in Financial Planning from Kaplan.</p>
   <p>His research spans conflict forecasting, defense sector dynamics, and modern mercantilist trade policy. He works from first principles, blending quantitative models with contextual judgment to extract signal from complexity.</p>
   <p>Yencken draws on formal study and independent inquiry across philosophy, history, mathematics, and the sciences. He maintains that breadth of knowledge and clarity of purpose are essential when seeking to understand the world—and to anticipate what may come.</p>
